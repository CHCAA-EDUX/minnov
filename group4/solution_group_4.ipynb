      "[INFO] idea 21.0: I think it would make the gifts of the Advent Calendar truely amazing, if after the 24th there would be a building instruction where using the the bricks of 24 small gifts you could make one big thing. F.ex for Star Wars that you could create a bigger spaceship with the bricks. First,  it would make  day 24 truely special. Second,  it would show to the kids that bricks can be used in different ways,  and encourage them to be creative (and not just assemble sets once).\"\n",

      "[INFO] idea 120.0: Consumer Services handles many contacts from disappointed fans who have purchased â€œfactory sealedâ€ packages that are missing all the minifigures. These consumers have usually bought the set at a non LBR retail store.   There is nothing worse than opening up your new Star Wars or Ninjago set and finding that the minifigures are all gone! The current tape that we use to seal the boxes can easily be tampered with. My colleague, Rocky, did an experiment with a TMNT set that he purchased.  Her carefully removed the tape, emptied the box and placed the tape back on the box.  The average consumer/retail associate would never have guessed that the tape had been removed.  We could possibly prevent a consumer from purchasing these tampered with boxes by using tamper proof tape. This tape would have red lines on it that break upon removal. It would prevent our partners (TRU, Wal-Mart, etc.)  from allowing â€œunopenedâ€ sets to be returned and resold to our valued fans.\n",

Why donÂ´t we expand this oppertunity to include bricks as well? This would be a win/win situation for the company and the employee. The company reduces the waste/scrap (Planet Promis) and the employee has access to bricks with a discount.\n",

I really dont like the cracks of air between the plates  and here this would be an awesome solution..Update: I uploaded a pictures of an element  we use internaly here in Verification  for setup up bricks for measurement.

      "[INFO] idea 204.0: Give the building an understanding of how far they are in the building experience and why they are building what they are building. Examples could be:* Step 4 of 45 - so the builder understand that they have a lot of steps to complete still, * Show on every page of a sub-build where the final construct will fit on the model\"\n",

      "[INFO] idea 13.0: New ways of playing LEGO have been innovated and develped for a decade. For example 2000-2001 STARWARS Yoda and Darth Vader figure are built by bricks, 2006 Spongebob figure built by bricks and this year 2012 STARWARS R2-D2 can be built by bricks. LEGO bricks can create everything. My new idea is the theme figures are not just minifigures, but also brick- buildings. There is something similar like the figures we saw in LEGOLAND which are built by the bricks. In future LEGO can develop and create more theme figures which are able to built by bricks. For example SUPERHERO BATMAN, LEGO FRIENDS figure, LEGO TOYSTORY BUSSYLIGHTYEAR &amp, WOODY and LEGO DRAGON. These cool  figures are able to draw the kids creativity and imagination.\n",

      "[INFO] idea 205.0: Hi :) During the christmas holiday  I was playing with LEGO City together with my nephew (4 years old). Suddenly he asked me how is was on the countryside,  he have never really been/seen a farm on close on. Because he is raised in Copenhagen  and my guess is that there are many kids aruond the world who do not know much about the countryside.  I am rasied on a farm and do know a thing or two about the daily life on the countryside  so I told him about it  and came to thing that it would be great if LEGO could learn kids about the life on a countryside with a playfull,  good experienced,  well learned story about how the diffrents products gets from the farms to the supermaket.  I can almost see the title \"\"LEGO City Countryside\"\" on the LEGO boxes. So now  Is it a good idea or not?????\"\n",

      "[INFO] idea 124.0: Will we be able to have a Staff Shop in the Slough office? If staffing it is an issue maybe we could have limited opening hours like an hour a day, manned on a rota basis. I guess space may also be an issue! It will be interesting to hear what people think.\n",

      "[INFO] idea 101.0: While building with city products it is easy to create roads and buildings to interact with but I have a difficult time building with my LOTR or SW sets with the background being green/blue/grey base plates and nothing that helps me imagine my ships actually flying through space or my armies marching on Mt doom. As most of us  are aware with the advent calendars that have small play space that allows us to have a mat to build on we are able to envision a christmas village or a scene from star wars. If we had this on the large scale as well it would help ous create a world for all of our different themes. These scenes could be on canvas or another material that lasts.\n",
